# Change Log of ARCADE

## [1.0.0] - 2017-06-28
### FIXED
*   Background color of pause screen is now properly set.
*   Updated tutorial documentation about Grating stimulus

##  [1.0.0b3] - 2017-06-21
### NEW
*   Added Gaussian stimulus

### CHANGED
*   Enhanced condition/block selection functions: block selection is evaluated
    first and its result can be used in the condition selection function as
    2nd argument.
*   Updated Grating stimulus to use new shader implementation

### FIXED
*   Increased refresh rate of ControlScreen to enhance capturing of key
    presses


## [1.0.0b2] - 2017-06-12
### NEW
*   Gammatron stimulus
*   Pixel-shaded picture stimulus (not yet documented)
*   PictureWithGaussianPatch stimulus (not yet documented)
*   Behavioral data from a session is now stored in a unique folder without
    subfolders for experiment and session.
*   Temporal frequencies of several stimuli are now expressed in cycles per s
*   ARCADE version is printed in log files if Git is installed

### FIXED
*   Missing nanmax function in PLTReactionTime
*   Month and day were swapped in date string


## [1.0.0b1] - 2017-05-31
### NEW
*   64-bit support: ARCADE runs on 64-bit MATLAB only (currently only 2014a).
    This allows for very long sessions (>9000 trials) and slightly improves
    performance.
*   Rewritten stimulus classes: stimulus definition has been simplified and
    can now be easily tested outside a running session. This unfortunately
    means existing task scripts have to be adapted. See tutorial documentation
    for an overview.
*   Documentation of all user-oriented functions and classes as well as
    tutorial documentation as been added.
*   New EyeServers: ARCADE provides now interfaces for eye tracking via (1)
    National Instruments Cards (SGLNiEyeServer), (2) ethernet from Eyelink SR
    1000/2000 (SGLEylinkEyeServer) and (3) a test eye signal for debugging
    (SGLTestEyeServer). Currently this has to be configured by manually
    changing line 44 of SGLEyeServerProc.m
*   Laptop mode: when no national instruments card can be detected,
    eventmarkers and reward will not be send out.
*   No MATLAB toolboxes are required to run ARCADE
*   Store events to disk: timestamps of eventmarkers are recorded in separate
    .evt file. The file can be read with readEvtFile.m
*   New file naming scheme: behavioral data files are now named according to
    the pattern subject_day_experiment_session
*   In case of crashing, the behavioral .esi and .hdr files can be converted
    to a MATLAB file using convertEsiFile.m
*   Eye position is now shared among processes via kernel32 NamedSharedMemory
*   Starting and stopping of data acquisition is now triggered via kernel32
    Events
*   The CoreControlScreenPipe was simplified and now only transfers the trial
    data
*   Processes are now managed using the MATLAB Java Runtime with
    processManager.m
*   SGLNiEyeServer now samples at a fixed rate
*   user32 functionality has been removed

### FIXED
*   Occasional freezing of ARCADE should not happen anymore. On pipe write
    error, the Core process continued to write instead of raising an error.
    This may have cause the hangups.
*   Several minor bugs.
